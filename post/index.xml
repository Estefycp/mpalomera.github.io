      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still remember what my mom said to me every night:  &amp;ldquo;Kid keep studying so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to work as hard as I have to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I kept studying but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I work less harder that my mom used to do. Been a developer is a really hard work, full of frustrations and long hours. If so why I still want to turn into a really good software developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a great moment to be a programmer, we are surrounded for hundreds of devices and there is software everywhere. From the editor that I am using, the radio, cell phone, clock &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been a developer on this world means understand it.  Be aware that behide of any bit that is comming from the internet cable are hundreds of men-hours from developers like me, which are working the best they can to build a more confortable / enjoyable world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end, we, the developers,  are trying to prove that  everybody in the whole world is just a click from distance.&lt;/p&gt;
